# PakStyleLens

PakStyleLens is a **fashion search and recommendation app** built with **Kotlin (Android)** and integrated with an AI-powered backend.
The app allows users to search for clothing items by **caption (text)** or by **uploading an image**, returning similar or relevant outfit suggestions.

## Features

* **AI Integration** → Backend powered by **YOLOv8** for detection + **FashionCLIP** for image-text similarity.
* **User Input** → Uses `EditText`, `ImageView`, and `Buttons` for easy interactions.
* **Fast & Lightweight** → Optimized resource usage with proper activity lifecycle handling.
